# Design Patterns

We have appters as ways to solve commong pÂ´roblems but this sohuld be use only in cases where they are really required as they increase the complexity of the code base by a lot. The best code is the one that can be understand just by reading it. We have three categories of patters:

## Creational patterns

Provide different forms to create objects

- Abstract factory
- Builder ( Allows to createtion of a variety of object from an oroginal object )
- Factory Method
