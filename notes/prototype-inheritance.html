      Almost everything in JavaScript is an object. In fact, only six things are
      not objects. They are — null , undefined , strings, numbers, boolean, and
      symbols. These are called primitive values or primitive types. So as we do
      not have classes instead of inheritance with classes we have prototype
      inheritance

      // we can take this even farther and beyond to where no one has ever go ⚡⚡⚡🌌🚀
      function Person5(name) {
        // when we use new there is not need to add this line 👇
        //const person = Object.create(personMethods);
        // now when we use new everything in prototype its instantiated in this
        this.name = name;
      }

      Person5.prototype.wave = function () {
        console.log(`Hi I am ${this.name} 👋`);
      };

      // new is basically sugar syntax but anyways it is really helpful
      const random69420 = new Person5('Chad Thundercock');
      random69420.wave();

      /**
       * Disclaimer
       * Nowadays everyone uses the keyword class wich is a sugar version of the last method
       */

      // hasOwnProperty this checks wheater the set property its included inside the object and not as an inherited one
      console.log(
        "random69420.hasOwnProperty('name') ",
        random69420.hasOwnProperty('name')
      );
      console.log(
        "random69420.hasOwnProperty('toString') ",
        random69420.hasOwnProperty('toString')
      );
      console.log(
        "random69420.hasOwnProperty('wave') ",
        random69420.hasOwnProperty('wave')
      );

      // when we call a property of an object in js we search for that property in the prototype chain wich its all the parents of the given obj until we find it if not undefined its retuerned
      // a simple object in Js has as parent the prototype object and as parent of that one the Object call Object which has basic functions such as toString()

      /**
       * myObj -> prototype -> Object
       *
       * inside myObj is where out params live
       * inside prototype is where our functions live
       * inside Object is where generic functions live
