      Almost everything in JavaScript is an object. In fact, only six things are
      not objects. They are — null , undefined , strings, numbers, boolean, and
      symbols. These are called primitive values or primitive types. So as we do
      not have classes instead of inheritance with classes we have prototype
      inheritance

    <script>
      // we can take this even farther and beyond to where no one has ever go ⚡⚡⚡🌌🚀
      function Person5(name) {
        // when we use new there is not need to add this line 👇
        //const person = Object.create(personMethods);
        // now when we use new everything in prototype its instantiated in this
        this.name = name;
      }

      Person5.prototype.wave = function () {
        console.log(`Hi I am ${this.name} 👋`);
      };

      // new is basically sugar syntax but anyways it is really helpful
      const random69420 = new Person5('Chad Thundercock');
      random69420.wave();

      /**
       * Disclaimer
       * Nowadays everyone uses the keyword class wich is a sugar version of the last method
